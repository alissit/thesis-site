        As the Roman Catholic Church grew and gained more prominent within the empire, so did the appearance of the Catholic Cross, their pagan symbol of religious worship that eventually overshadowed the Chi-Rho.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Having established earlier that Constantine had a fascination and respect for the ever-growing Christian movement (just as long as it didn’t lead to unrest and violence within the Empire), he wasn’t the only one who was drawn to this new religion. True Christians were mindful not to fall into the trap of latching onto pagan (ungodly) signs and symbols for Christian worship, and Constantine, not a true spiritual/confirmed believer, found himself doing the same. The Chi-Rho symbol was never a physical image or object to be used for the purpose of worship, but merely a representation for showing appreciation for Christ, the Son of God. And seeing as Christ was apt at using illustrations to draw people to his Heavenly Father, why couldn’t the Chi-Rho (XP) have been used for the same purpose by Christ’s followers? It was! Except, the Jupiter Trinity (with a military following) was later assimilated into a purpose more fitting for Catholicism.

By the time Innocenzo was 17, he was ordained a cardinal by the Church, but this proved disastrous. After Julius’ death, Innocenzo indulged in rape and murder. The Church shunned him but let him keep his title. Innocenzo died…abused!</p>

        The sexual depravity of Pope Julius III was not hidden from the Catholic Church by any means! He exploited it in a fresco commissioned by painter Peitro Venale, which can be seen today in Rome by many millions of tourists who visit Julius’ old house of pleasure, the Villa Giulia. The old fresco features, believe it or not, a boy masturbating another, while perched on a vine trellis.  The boys don’t appear to have any wings, so we can only assume that these non-cherubs must have been the much-preferred manifestation from the minds of Popes. The coin below is not an advertisement for a recent costume party in San Francisco, but is a commemorative coin celebrating the day when Julius was ordained as the Pope, Head of the Roman Catholic Church. And get this! Pope Julius was the inventor of the Sacrament of Confession. Yikes! The Church must have thought that this pontiff was so super-righteous that he was untouchable by God. The Babylonian ruler Nimrod lost his Tower of Power due to nothing short of narcissism and blasphemy.  Could there be a repeat of that soon…?

               The Holy Inquisition was spearheaded by Pope Gregory IX. It was a vicious and heinous way of forcing people into confessing to being either a sorcerer, witch, homosexual, lesbian, Jew, Protestant, and all Christian nonconformists, including nontrinitarians. The victims who suffered the most were women, especially when it came to the most sadistic form of torture device, known as the “Pope’s Pear” (also Pear of Anguish).  This pear-shaped tool was inserted inside a woman’s vagina and the screw handle was then turned until the woman agonizingly confessed to who the Roman Catholic Church believed was a gross sinner (witch etc.). Due to painful duress, a confession would been brought on quickly regardless of whether the victim was guilty or not, and the guilty then faced further agony when they were taken outside and burned at the stake.

            The Pope used Franciscan friars to carry out this atrocity, probably assuming they could successfully humiliate women who were being tortured, while they in no way were aroused by the sight of a naked body due to the Franciscan vow of abstinence. Sentence of Death was enforced mostly upon a layman (not members of the Clergy), which included women, but  the Vatican had a history of ordaining a layman to their priesthood. Cover-ups were a dime-a-dozen. If a Catholic bishop was found guilty of dabbling in sorcery via doubling as a Shaman priest, then they got nothing more than having their right-hand (the one they use for blessing Christians) impaled on an upright piece of wood in the public square. Being burned at the stake was the Catholic Church’s way of giving a major sinner a quick road to Hell, but as for the clergy…well, it wasn’t uncommon for them to protect their own no matter what.

<h3 class="header-title_page16 pb-3">CASTRATION</h3>
<p>
    Castration was a practice common in the Middle Ages, which became something endorsed by the Catholic Church. It was usually done for two main reasons—to curb the unrestrained sexual desires of serial rapists and unrepentant thugs, and to ensure the longevity of the angelic-like voices of singing Church choir boys.  It was done mostly by the local barbers, but when their obligation to the Church began to dwindle, Catholic priests were trained to continue the procedure. One Medieval barber in Rome was known to have had a
sign outside of his place of employment that read: “Castration Done Here For Papal Choir.”

    During the 1950’s, 10 Dutch teenage boys and young men under the age of 21 were surgically castrated in the Roman Catholic Church’s attempt to rid homosexuality inside a Catholic boarding home. Henk Heithus, 20, reported the abuse to the police, but they ignored it and transferred Henk to a Catholic psychiatric hospital. While there, Henk was castrated. He died two years later in a car accident. The hospice staff claimed that Henk wanted to be castrated, and they didn’t think that his parents needed to be informed prior to the procedure. An investigation uncovered 1,800 reports of rampant sexual abuse by the clergy and volunteers within Dutch Catholic dioceses in a period since 1945.
