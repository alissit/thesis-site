        Above is the Catholic clergy saluting their chief, Adolf Hitler, the god of war, extermination, and Saturnalia of blood. It would appear they chose to ignore the biblical memo, barring Christians from going to war and killing their human brothers. Their fear of man was obviously a lot stronger than their fear of God. Those displaying a true Christian fear of God, the Conscientious Objectors, were real examples of people displaying faith!

        “Come join the Crusade and see the world!” Sounds like an attractive advertisement for a cruise, right?  Peter the Hermit never actually heralded those particular words, but his fiery gift of the gab certainly stirred up the frenzied masses to follow him into a so-called “Holy War” (First Christian Crusade), a war sanctioned by <span class="text_red">Pope Urban II</span>. If Peter truly believed in God’s Word at Psalms 146:3, which says: “Put not your trust in princes (nobles) nor in the son of man, in whom there is no hope,” wouldn’t the blood of innocent people have been spared? So… all of you out there reading this are probably thinking to yourselves… “Hmm, but this Peter the Hermit guy, wasn’t he a man of the cloth, a man of God? Wasn’t he a representative of the Pope, the Head of the Roman Catholic Church, right??? Reaching the Yugoslavian city of Zemun was one indication, above others, that the war where Peter led his army into was not a holy war. It was there where Peter’s army accidently slaughtered <span class="text_red">4,000 Christian residents (men, women, and children)</span>.  And what sparked such an enormous atrocity as that…?

        <span class="text_red">Pope Pius XII (reigned 1939-58)</span>  (formally Archbishop Eugene Pacelli)
    </p>
    <p>
        Pontiff, extortionist, god of war, extermination, racism, and Saturnalia of Blood
    </p>

                <p>
                   Pope Benedict XV commissioned and authorized Archbishop Pacelli, then a papal ambassador, to go to Munich, Germany, in May, 1917, under the sly, diplomatic guise to negotiate a Concordat (Treaty) with largely Protestant Germany. To fully-assist in negotiating an agreement, the Pope authorized the release of 60 cases of gold (over 1,000 gold bars) valued between $80-$100 million U.S. dollars, funds obtained through dishonest means, crime. The gold accompanied Archbishop Pacelli under the shady pretense of being 60 cases of special foods for his delicate stomach. The hidden funds were not intended for supporting the failing German government and military, which was evident as World War I was coming to an end, but supposedly for the support of anti-Communist political movements and sympathizers.

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        In 1919-20, Archbishop Pacelli actively campaigned to have black French troops removed from the Rhineland (Germany), accusing them of raping women and abusing children. The U.S. Congress held an independent inquiry and proved the allegation false, but this future Pope’s racism didn’t end there.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1943-44, Pope Pius XII, formally Archbishop Pacelli, especially requested the British Foreign Office that no colored troops be garrisoned in Rome after the occupation. For all of you who are still plagued by a nagging curiosity as to what really happened to all the gold that was sent along with Archbishop Pacelli to Germany back in 1917… it was used to fund the rapidly expanding Nazi Party, including its first reform as a paramilitary organization in 1921.

    <p>
        (1920-1945) Archbishop Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) and the <span class="text_red">Jesuit order</span> under the control of Superior-General Wlodimir Ledochowski helped form the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (German Worker’s Party), DAP for short, into the National Socialist German Worker’s Party (NSDAP), also known as the Nazi Party. Archbishop Pacelli mentored Hitler into joining DAP, and it was Archbishop Pacelli who financially supported Hitler’s rise to Chairman of the NSDAP.  The purpose of the Nazi Party, as formed by the Catholic Church, was to (1) establish a pro-Catholic political party capable of defeating its opposition and gaining control of government; (2) establish a concordant between the Catholic Church and the whole of Germany guaranteeing a massive financial pipeline in compensation for losing the papal states <span class="text_red">(this mega-cash cow Church tax still generates billions of dollars to this day)</span>; and (3) the elimination of all opposition including social reform/democratic minded groups, especially Protestants, Communists, and ethnic Jews. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1921, on instruction from Superior-General Wlodimir Ledochowski, Archbishop Pacelli instructed Adolf  Hitler to establish a paramilitary wing to the NSDAP to be known as the Stumabteilung (SA). Hitler was instructed to take his paramilitary organization and begin using <span class="text_red">Jesuit priests</span> to fully train them in  espionage, Counterintelligence, assassination, and propaganda. The purpose of the SA was to assist in the control of organized protests, riots, intimidation of opponents, and political assassinations. The Germans used Storm Troopers as far back as World War I, but this elite group became more prominent in association with the SA for their covert skills during WW2.      
    </p>

    <p>
        (1929-1945)  A secret agreement by Superior-General Wlodimir Ledochowski, and later confirmed by Pope Pius XII upon his ascension to the throne, gave SS officers of the Nazis spiritual powers of Jesuit priests, regardless of whether they were married or not. By 1939, and upon the power of the Pope, these actions of conferring  priestly powers to SS officers active in the Final Solution (extermination), was in full knowledge of their orders and acts of barbarity and inhumanity.
    </p>

    <p>
        (1939-1945) Pope Pius XII, with the full knowledge and support of Ledochowski, handed to Hitler and Himmler stringent details for the systematic elimination of key non-Catholic minorities across Europe, as well as the establishment of death camps, for their murder. The Pope also instructed that ethnic Jews and other heretics were not simply to be murdered, but ritually sacrificed by being burnt alive, which he deemed consistent with Church law on the penalty of heresy. The German commanders came up with a plan using Zyklon-B to render the victims unconscious in the gas chambers. They were then restrained unconscious and carted to the furnaces, and, when they regained consciousness, were burnt alive in those furnaces. In 1943, the Nazis entered Rome and the Germans began deporting over 1,000 Jews who lived near the Vatican. Hitler openly invited the Pope to criticize him for this act, but the Pope declined, thus ceiling the doom of those Jews who were sent to Auschwitz for burning. Pope Pius XII never once apologized for failing to stop the deportation. During World War II, Jews in Poland were being burned alive in barns, which numbered some 1600 men, women, and children (i.e. Massacre of Jedwabne).
