        Above is the Catholic clergy saluting their chief, Adolf Hitler, the god of war, extermination, and Saturnalia of blood. It would appear they chose to ignore the biblical memo, barring Christians from going to war and killing their human brothers. Their fear of man was obviously a lot stronger than their fear of God. Those displaying a true Christian fear of God, the Conscientious Objectors, were real examples of people displaying faith!

        “Come join the Crusade and see the world!” Sounds like an attractive advertisement for a cruise, right?  Peter the Hermit never actually heralded those particular words, but his fiery gift of the gab certainly stirred up the frenzied masses to follow him into a so-called “Holy War” (First Christian Crusade), a war sanctioned by <span class="text_red">Pope Urban II</span>. If Peter truly believed in God’s Word at Psalms 146:3, which says: “Put not your trust in princes (nobles) nor in the son of man, in whom there is no hope,” wouldn’t the blood of innocent people have been spared? So… all of you out there reading this are probably thinking to yourselves… “Hmm, but this Peter the Hermit guy, wasn’t he a man of the cloth, a man of God? Wasn’t he a representative of the Pope, the Head of the Roman Catholic Church, right??? Reaching the Yugoslavian city of Zemun was one indication, above others, that the war where Peter led his army into was not a holy war. It was there where Peter’s army accidently slaughtered <span class="text_red">4,000 Christian residents (men, women, and children)</span>.  And what sparked such an enormous atrocity as that…?

        <span class="text_red">Pope Pius XII (reigned 1939-58)</span>  (formally Archbishop Eugene Pacelli)
    </p>
    <p>
        Pontiff, extortionist, god of war, extermination, racism, and Saturnalia of Blood
    </p>

    <div class="row align-items-center">
         <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>
                   Pope Benedict XV commissioned and authorized Archbishop Pacelli, then a papal ambassador, to go to Munich, Germany, in May, 1917, under the sly, diplomatic guise to negotiate a Concordat (Treaty) with largely Protestant Germany. To fully-assist in negotiating an agreement, the Pope authorized the release of 60 cases of gold (over 1,000 gold bars) valued between $80-$100 million U.S. dollars, funds obtained through dishonest means, crime. The gold accompanied Archbishop Pacelli under the shady pretense of being 60 cases of special foods for his delicate stomach. The hidden funds were not intended for supporting the failing German government and military, which was evident as World War I was coming to an end, but supposedly for the support of anti-Communist political movements and sympathizers.

         <div class="col-md-2">

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        In 1919-20, Archbishop Pacelli actively campaigned to have black French troops removed from the Rhineland (Germany), accusing them of raping women and abusing children. The U.S. Congress held an independent inquiry and proved the allegation false, but this future Pope’s racism didn’t end there.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1943-44, Pope Pius XII, formally Archbishop Pacelli, especially requested the British Foreign Office that no colored troops be garrisoned in Rome after the occupation. For all of you who are still plagued by a nagging curiosity as to what really happened to all the gold that was sent along with Archbishop Pacelli to Germany back in 1917… it was used to fund the rapidly expanding Nazi Party, including its first reform as a paramilitary organization in 1921.
