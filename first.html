      One of the forefathers of the early Church (later known as the Roman Catholic Church) was a man named Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea. Many Catholics viewed Eusebius as a saint, but he was nothing more than a coward, a liar, and an opportunist. 

    </p>
    <p>
      Christian Martyrs, known as the Arians, were branded as being heretics for refusing to accept the Trinity Doctrine. Unwilling to share the same fate as the Arians, Eusebius went into hiding.  Although having been taught the ways of a nontrinitarian, Eusebius later switched sides for fear of losing his life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Eusebius and another Christian historian, Lactantius, waited until Emperor Constantine died, then concocted fraudulent news that Constantine had been given a divine vision of a Christian symbol--a cross superimposed over the sun by Christ. Eusebius gives two accounts, but fails to mention the vision in the first one.  The ruse continued with Constantine, who was said to have been urged by Christ to mark that symbol on the shields of his soldiers prior to winning the Battle of Milvian Bridge in Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizens of the Roman Empire commonly worshipped multiple gods, and Constantine, although fascinated by the Christian faith, was sympathetic towards Christians primarily because his father, Constantius, shared the same sympathetic view.  If Christ was responsible for aiding Constantine at the Battle of Milvian Bridge against Emperor Maxentius, then the second battle with the emperor usurper, Licinius, would have had the Cross marked on the shields and helmets of Constantine, but the cross wasn’t marked, just like it was absent at the Battle of Milvian Bridge. The Chi-Rho (XP—first two Greek letters of CHRIST’S name) was used! Failure to use the Chi-Rho would have meant a bad omen for Constantine, but not if the supposed vision of Eusebius and Lactantius never actually happened. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Impressed as he was with the rise of Christianity, Constantine continued to be devout in worshipping the same god as his father, namely: Sol Invictus (the Unconquered Sun). Sun worship was popular across the globe well before Christianity became a state religion, and the pagan Sun symbol was a cross, but not the same Cross (idol) that Eusebius and Lactantius saw as a God/worship symbol.

      American President Donald Trump coined the phrase: “Fake News.”  It was Eusebius who should have been awarded the same biblical term that was given to Satan the Devil: “the Father of the Lie.”  Eusebius went as far as making a statement (recorded in his Praeraratio Evangelico) that lying was okay if warranted by any situation.  If lying is acceptable in the eyes of God, then swearing an oath to tell the truth in court would never have made its way down through the centuries as it did.  To ascertain just how much the Church adopted Eusebius’ fake news, let’s examine the facts…
