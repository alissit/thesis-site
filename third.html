       Israelite King Herod, like so many of the past Roman emperors, feared anyone who could be a potential usurper to his throne or his royal line, so much so that he even killed his own ambitious son. After hearing about the prophesied birth of Jesus, Herod sent the three wise men to locate the newborn infant. When they found Jesus, he was in a “house”, not a manger! The King had death in mind for the Son of God. From a logical standpoint, would God really have directed those astrologers (sacrificial priests) to Jesus so that it resulted in the infant’s death? No! The star that they followed was a result of demonic intervention, that’s why those astrologers never returned to Herod, as a result of Divine intervention. (Mathew 2:11, 12, 16-18) Those astrologers also had more satanic talents besides studying the stars. They were Magi priests who were linked to child sacrifice, a popular and ungodly practice   back in the day, which accompanied Sun worship and harvest festivals. (Deut. 12:31 & Jeremiah 32:35)

        Let’s not forget that when Jesus was born, the shepherds were living “outdoors” with their flocks (Luke 2:8), which meant they would have froze to death. Those animals would have been put inside an enclosure (cave, manger etc.) if it was mid-winter. The month was more likely to be that of October.   December 25th was the day the Temple of Sol Invictus and its priestly college was officially completed.   Sunday was created as a rest day for religious observance to coincide with it. The Catholic Church later assimilated it.

This German myth/folk tale consists of a fairy-like goddess of fertility, who flies through the heavens, surrounded by cherubs, beams of light, and rabbits. If I was employed centuries ago in the Marketing Department of the Catholic Church, I, too, wouldn’t hesitate for a second in snatching up this little piece of major product placement, oven ready for religious exploitation. Seeing as it already had a cult following, then it couldn’t get any better than that! The Anglo-Saxons were the first to adopt this nippy little vixen…with the Catholic Church grabbing her later.

        To the unwary, some ancient Roman coins that remained legal tender for centuries could easily have fooled people into believing that a temple of worship, which had a cross attached, was primarily a place for Christian worship, but when you match it next to an engraved image of a temple that featured the emperor Marcus Aurelius, the cross can be seen as nothing more than wooden paneling in the doors of a temple used for the worship of Roman emperors or their gods. And that’s not a cross on the temple’s apex, either!

 <p style="text-decoration:underline;"><img src="assets/third/page21/image136.png" style="width:30px;"> <strong>SHAMANS</strong></p>

 <p>
    Shamans started as tribal priests, then became Egyptian magic-practicing priests, sorcerers, and over time turned up as witch doctors and contactors of evil spirits. Many centuries before Christ was born, Tammuz priests (child-killers) believed they were mediators between their god and man. They dropped the horizontal part of the “T” in their god’s name, which then become a symbol for the Sun. 
 </p>
 <p>
    Fertility and agriculture were a big part of the Shaman’s lives--a good harvest meant their god was pleased, but a bad harvest meant a bad omen and the land was cursed, not to mention the people. This lead to the heinous ritual of human (infant) sacrifice. Tammuz means: “Purify by Fire”. The biblical prophet Moses had the upper hand over the magic practicing priests when God brought the 10 plagues of Egypt.

                <p>
                  The Greek coin above, dated 190-180 BCE, features the pagan Greek goddess Hekate holding torches to light the darkness at the Crossroads where the land of the living meet the land of the dead, which is also represented by the cross symbol seen on it. The images of Hekate usually have her with a halo of sunrays (similar to Sol Invictus) emanating from her head, like a light beacon for illuminating the point where the dead meet the living. It’s ironic that the Word of God (Bible) mentions that “Satan is transformed into an angel of light.”—2 Cor. 11:14 
                  The current Pope keeps a statue of Hekate in his trophy room (the Vatican Museum).

    <p><strong>Bernard de Castanet </strong>(1240-1317) Lawyer, judge, Catholic cardinal-bishop, member of the Inquisition

                   Bernard was Bishop of Albi, and during this time he had a power struggle with local land owners. It was Bernard’s intent to build a fortress-like cathedral in a place he deemed suitable no matter who objected. In fact, so determined was Bernard in getting his way that he lowered himself to the role of a fear-mongerer. Bernard thus accused those who opposed his decisions of being heretics, a crime that led a person to being burned at the stake. This kind of persuasive fear-mongering wasn’t new with the Roman Catholic Church. If it had been, their concept of eternal torment in hell would never have come about. It’s nothing short of productplacement, designed to bolster Sunday Church attendance and keep contributions flowing in. Today, it’s called PTL, only with less emphasis on Praise The Lord and more on Pass The Loot.

        <p>
           In 1307, Bernard got himself into a bit of a bother when he was accused of murder, pastoral neglect, simony, cruelty in the exercise of justice, and 42 other offenses. Even with the damning testimony of 114 witnesses, Pope Clement V still, after all that, swept the evidence under the papal carpet and  restored Bernard’s official duties to  him. If  Bernard was a man of the cloth, he was more in need of a spiritual wash cloth than anything else!

           <strong> Gilles de Rais</strong> (1405-1440) French lord, Catholic/Christian…? knight, leader of the French Army
        </p>
        <p>
            You may not remember the name, but you will most certainly know his companion-in-arms, Joan of Arc.  Those demonic voices that Joan supposedly heard in her head prior to her execution…well, they might just have whispered a few evil intentions into the ears of this revered and high-ranking warrior. During  the years 1431-1440, Gilles became known as one of the most sadistic, child serial killers in all of France  for murdering and butchering some 80  boys and  girls, ages 4-18, for self-sexual gratification. At the time, the number was thought to possibly be as high as 200. And get this! During that same time, Gilles had a church built, called the <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Chapel of the Holy Innocents.</span> Gilles’ relatives appealed to Pope Eugene IV to disavow Gilles’ church but the Pope refused to do so. Gilles and two accomplices were arrested, tried, and hung for what they did. But just when you thought it safe to get this disturbing account farthest from your mind, <span class="text_red">it doesn’t end there!!!</span> Gilles’ last request to be buried in the <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Church of the Monastery of Notre-Dame de Carmes</span> was granted by the Church!

                   Father Schmidt was a German Catholic priest who immigrated to America in 1909. Assigned to St. John’s Church in Louisville, Kentucky, Father Schmidt was linked to the diabolical murder of a 9-year old girl, Alma Kellner (of German descent). The girl was butchered. Joseph endling, the janitor, was framed for her murder and given life in prison due to evidence left at his home. The Church covered up Schmidt’s involvement by moving him on to St. Boniface’s Church in New York City. It was there where Father Schmidt got his rectory housekeeper Anna Aumueller,an Austrian immigrant, pregnant before murdering her. Father Schmidt chopped up her body, as he had done with Alma Kellner, and threw the pieces into the river to hide the evidence. But the body parts were soon discovered. Father Hans Schmidt was implicated, found guilty, and given the electric chair for the despicable crime that he committed, leaving Wendling to rot in jail.

                   Back in 1980, the town of Toledo, Ohio was rocked by the vicious, ritualistic rape and murder of a 71-year old Catholic nun, Sister Ann Pahl. She was strangled, raped, had an alter cloth put over her, and then stabbed repeatedly 31 times inside of a hospital chapel (supposedly sacred ground to a Catholic). Father Gerald Robinson, the 56-year old priest who also worked at the chapel, denied any knowledge of the killing. 
                   With that, the case went cold…that was until 30-years later when a woman came forward and accused Father Robinson of raping her during a ritualistic sacrifice when she was a child. After forensics ran tests on Robinson’s old letter opener, traces of Sister Pahl’s blood was found on it, and  Father Robinson got life in prison for her murder.

          The Catholic Church has long thought that God cannot see the sins of the clergy, hence its reputation for shuffling their sexual predator/priests around from one location to another, as if fixing a seriously major problem with a mere Band-Aid. Well, here’s something more serious  for them to ponder over:  “<strong>For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifices for sins.</strong>”–(<span style="font-style:italic;">Hebrews 10:26 </span> King James Bible)

                   That disturbing cry was heard as the Catholic knights charged into battle during the Christian Crusades. If I were a betting man, I wouldn’t hesitate to pinpoint the guilty culprit as being one Bishop Adhemer of le Puy, who rode with the rest of his slaughtering horde, converting or massacring Jews, nontrinitarians, and Muslims. The cry was in response to the 200 severed Muslim heads about to be catapulted. His <span class="text_red">(ISIS-like)</span> lust for blood was no less strong than that of Satan the Devil’s. “He was a murderer (manslayer) from the beginning.”—(John 8:44) The biblical admonition to “love thy neighbor” does not mean to violently force someone in a neighboring land to conform to your religious belief.

        <p>The African slave trade was started by European Catholics, Portuguese, and British mostly, and continued, culminating in the Abolition of Slavery, thus sparking the American Civil War. That war had Catholic Christians on both sides shooting at each other, which cost the lives of 620,000 men. Racism was the aftermath of that, and still is by hypocritical Christians, and others.</p>
